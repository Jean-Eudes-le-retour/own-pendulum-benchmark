## How to participate

### Create your own entry repository from the template

Click on the green "Use this template" at the top of this repo page.
Then fill the "Repository name" field with a name for your controller.
Choose the visibility of your controller, keep it "Public" if you don't care about people looking at your controller code otherwise set it to "Private".
Finally, click on the green "Create repository from template".

### Add the organizer as collaborator if you set your repository as private

Go to your personal repository page (https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME).
Next, go to the "Settings" tab and under "Access" click on the "Collaborators" section.
You will then need to confirm the access by re-entering your GitHub password.
When this is done you should see a "Manage access" box where you will see the current collaborators of the repo.
Click on the "Add people" and search for the name of the organizer. When you found the organizer, add them to the repository.

### Submit your entry by using posting an issue using the provided template

After you added the organizer as a collaborator, copy your full repository URL and go back to the organizer repository (this page normally)
and go to the issue tab.
Click on "New issue" and choose the "Registration to benchmark" option by clicking on "Get started".
Paste your repository URL in the field and click the "Submit new issue" button.
A series of automated actions will take place. If everything went well, you should get a message saying that you are successfully registered to the benchmark.

### Modify the template controller and/or create your own one

Everything should be good to go, you can modify the files in the controllers folder.
The supervisor controller is a special controller that is used to evaluate your controller's performance.
The only controller that is going to be used for the leaderboard is the one named like the template controller.
